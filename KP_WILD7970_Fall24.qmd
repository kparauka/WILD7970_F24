**Writing Prompt - Week 2**

*First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?*

"The River Continuum Concept (RCC)" authored by Vannote et al. 1980 was (and perhaps still is) one of the most influential papers in fisheries and stream ecology. Essentially, it proposed a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and function of lotic ecosystems with an emphasis on longitudinal connectivity from headwaters to mouth. Its interdisciplinarity was revolutionary, since it incorporates principles from geomorphology, biology, and biogeochemistry. And its mechanistic nature enabled predictions about changes in nutrient cycling, energy flow, and community structure along a longitudinal gradient, which represented a major shift in stream ecology (at the time) from descriptive- to predictive research approaches.

Finding a current "disruptive" paper was difficult. I think that fisheries and stream ecology had a bit of a renaissance from the late 70s or so until the early 2000s in which a lot of pivotal pieces of literature were published. Since then, it seems like the field has largely been exploring the implications of those studies (as well as quantitative and statistical methods, which may very well be undergoing a renaissance of their own, though I don't feel confident speaking to that). I had to reach a bit (*sorry...*) to find a more current paper that could reasonably be considered ground-breaking or disruptive and landed on "Species detection using environmental DNA from water samples" published in Biology Letters by Ficetola et al. (2008). The study was conducted on American bullfrogs, but has had extraordinary implications for fisheries and aquatic ecology more generally. It demonstrated an efficient, non-invasive, and highly sensitive method of detecting the presence of specific aquatic organisms, which facilitated later applications to monitoring invasive and cryptic species. It's tipped the scales for critically endangered species, seemingly preventing some Romeo and Juliet-esque scenarios. eDNA monitoring techniques are still in development, but show substantial promise with regard to what they can offer scientists.

I'm really hesitant to admit that disruptive science is declining in fisheries ecology, in part because I think that's a rather pessimistic view of the field. But it seems like the difficulty that I had finding a current, paradigm-shifting paper would support that trend. For better or worse, I think what I'm going to choose to believe is that there's some sort of periodicity to science - that there are probably prolonged seasons of consolidating science punctuated by shorter bouts of disruptive science. I think that perspective reconciles declines in disruptive science with a more optimistic point of view.

**Writing Prompt - Week 3**

*Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?*

Frankly, I kind of resent the role that scientific computing has assumed in fisheries. I can obviously see the value of the analyses that it allows, but I personally identify as a boots-on-the-ground type of biologist and I really struggle with the learning curve associated with these tools and techniques.

I actually took an R-based ecological analysis course in my final semester of undergrad and it was awful. I failed the class, largely because it felt like something that I just couldn't understand. I realize now that teaching style had a lot to do with that, but I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. Some of these learning curves are really steep and feel impossible at times. While I'm relatively comfortable with R now, I think we should normalize being really bad at coding! And also remember that making observations of natural phenomena is the first step of the scientific method. Being an inquisitive and observant field biologist is no less important or valuable than being good at analysis and computing.

That being said, there's one really great new program that I'm excited about using in my research. Really all it does is streamline the sonar image processing that I have to do, but it's open source and represents an important step towards democratizing sonar surveys. Besides that, I'm trying to keep the computing in my research as simple as possible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Writing Prompt - Week 4**

*We left a couple of questions open-ended in our class discussion today. Please write 2-3 paragraphs addressing how you would handle reviewers of your own manuscript that provide feedback that you simply disagree with and/or contradicts feedback from another reviewer.*

I don't think that disagreement between reviewers or between authors and reviewers is inherently a bad thing. In fact, I think it can serve as an effective system of checks and balances when the peer review process is functioning the way it should. More eyes on a manuscript should mean that flaws which might go unnoticed by one reviewer would get caught by another. And reviews and recommendations should conflict sometimes because they're composed by humans who draw from different knowledge bases and experiences when formulating them. I think disagreements that arise in good faith are an important safeguard against scientific echo chambers.

And I think this is a fairly healthy framework for thinking about criticism, though its probably much more difficult to consider the bigger picture when faced with this scenario in "real life." I've not yet submitted a manuscript of my own, so I really don't have any first hand experience with this process from the author's perspective. But, I like to think I could accept disagreement between reviewers as an expression of checks and balances. And I'd like to think that I could consider my material in light of their perspectives and make a decision on what to keep, edit, or delete. I'd also like to think that if there was feedback that I had a good reason for disagreeing with, I'd stand by my work. I'm sure that's too idealistic and maybe a little reductive, but academia hasn't quite turned me into a cynic yet.

## Writing Prompt - Week 5

*Discuss the implications of predatory journals on scientific credibility, public perception, and the spread of misinformation in today's climate of growing anti-science sentiment. We would love to hear about a relevant example from your discipline.*

Predatory journals are definitely damaging to scientific credibility and public perception of science. I think that's virtually indisputable. And I think the reasoning behind that is straightforward: they're a mechanism by which poorly executed science can receive a false stamp of approval and be distributed to a broader audience. I also think that most everyone is going to mention social media somewhere in response to this prompt, and they'll probably all say something to the effect of social media and predatory journals being a dangerous combination. All of that seems pretty obvious, and I agree.

But regarding the circulation of misinformation, I don't think there's really much that anyone can do on the back end of things. Once a paper is "out there" in the "real world" no one can rightfully control how others choose to use it. I guess on the front end, authors could try to write in a way that minimizes the possibility of misinterpretation and choose to publish in reputable journals. But as long as the predatory journal model is profitable, they (and the "bad" science they propagate) won't go away. If their stream of revenue is coming from authors, then that's probably where the opportunity to influence their success lies. I think as a community, holding other scientists accountable to the processes that give science its rigor and credibility and penalizing those who knowlingly violate those processes is a good place to start.

Truthfully, I don't have a great example from fisheries off the top of my head. However, there's an ongoing issue with the College of Ag routinely publishing in MDPI journals.

## Writing Prompt - Week 6

*Dr. Andrews develops an amazing research idea. She and her postdoc bring in 4 collaborators from other universities and they all work to write a proposal which is funded for almost 3 million dollars. From there, Dr. Andrews has almost nothing to do with the implementation of the project. Her postdoc handles the work in her lab, and the collaborators each hire graduate students to handle the work in their labs. Three years later, when all of the data have been collected, Dr. Andrews expects to be an author on every paper associated with this grant (the project was her idea after all), but this was NOT discussed ahead of time.*

*Pretend you are one of Dr. Andrews' collaborators. Would you agree to have her on every paper you and your graduate student publish from this grant? Do you think this is a reasonable request? Justify your answer, and discuss how you would handle discussing this with Dr. Andrews.*

My initial impression is that this is not a completely unreasonable request. Developing the idea and helping secure (substantial) funding for the project...that's a nontrivial contribution. The scenario also doesn't really specify what happened after data collection. If Dr. Andrews provided expertise with regards to data analysis or participated in the manuscript revision process, then by all means, include them.

But for argument's sake, if their involvement ended after funding was secured, I think that I'd probably just include them as an author and be done with it. It really doesn't seem like a hill worth dying on, in my opinion. After all, it sounds like the project would have been a nonstarter without their early contributions. And if they're not expecting to be the second, third, fourth author...who cares? It doesn't cost anything to include them (does it?) and it saves everyone the headache of trying to resolve a conflict delicately.

This is an interesting scenario though. It's almost the exact opposite of one that a (past) member of my lab is experiencing right now. In both cases, it comes down to authorship as a form of social currency in science. I think that sometimes you're better off just paying up, because the consequences of burning a bridge to prove a point can be harmful to the entire ecosystem of researchers that you're a part of.

## Writing Prompt - Week 7

*Sharing manuscripts on pre-print servers before they have been accepted by a journal has been touted as one means of advancing open science practices. Discuss some of the pros and cons of this practice and weigh in on whether you have tried or would try pre-printing your manuscripts in the future.*

I can see the value of pre-printing in fast paced, competitive fields, I guess. Being able to establish a claim to your findings or your ideas would certainly help prevent someone else from doing so, even if they arrived at the same conclusions or came up with the same ideas independently. But I think this is a really disheartening point of view. Maybe the reality is that science, broadly speaking, is no less of a rat race than anything else. I'd consider perpetuating that cycle a con. But, if pre-printing results in a useful tool or technique being available to others as soon as reasonably possible, then it could also a serve a sort of greater good.

Realistically, I don't think that I would ever try pre-printing a manuscript. And that decision is kind of the result of this scenario: there's one pre-print that I cite fairly regularly about a particular program that I use to process some of my data. And I feel confident both using that software *and* citing the pre-print about it *because* I know the developer/author. I also know one of the co-authors and have for a very long time. All of this is to say that there is some very well-established credibility associated with the material, so I don't really have any qualms with the fact that the manuscript is a pre-print. On the other hand, I would probably hesitate to cite a pre-print by someone that I was not familiar with to some degree because of the lack of established credibility. So as an early career professional with no publications and a small circle of people with whom I've established credibility, I wouldn't feel confident pre-printing, say, the manuscript associated with my thesis research. I'd want more time and work (generally speaking) under my belt before I'd ever consider that route. And that being said, I have absolutely no interest any position that expects publications of this nature as part of the job. So, I doubt that this is a dilemma that I'll encounter with much frequency in the future.

## Writing Prompt - Week 8

*Explain how you would define an "ethical journal."*

I think, foremost, an ethical journal seeks to balance operating costs and profit margins in a way that minimizes financial barriers to access on the readers' end. Essentially, I would expect it to collect a more modest profit. And I think that the core values of an ethical journal are important too. They should strive to uphold scientific rigor and make the pursuit and dissemination of knowledge their primary goals, not generating profit. I think that an ethical journal takes accountability for the science that it publishes, and is willing to reject or retract work that lacks integrity.
