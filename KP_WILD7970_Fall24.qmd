Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: Â¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

**Writing Prompt - Week 2**

*First, describe what you consider to be one of the most ground-breaking or "disruptive" papers in your field. Next, describe the most ground-breaking or disruptive paper in your field in the past 5-10 years. Do you believe the disruptive or paradigm-shifting nature of the work in your field has declined in recent years? Why or why not?*

"The River Continuum Concept (RCC)" authored by Vannote et al. 1980 was (and perhaps still is) one of the most influential papers in fisheries and stream ecology. Essentially, it proposed a comprehensive framework for understanding the structure and function of lotic ecosystems with an emphasis on longitudinal connectivity from headwaters to mouth. Its interdisciplinarity was revolutionary, since it incorporates principles from geomorphology, biology, and biogeochemistry. And its mechanistic nature enabled predictions about changes in nutrient cycling, energy flow, and community structure along a longitudinal gradient, which represented a major shift in stream ecology (at the time) from descriptive- to predictive research approaches.

Finding a current "disruptive" paper was difficult. I think that fisheries and stream ecology had a bit of a renaissance from the late 70s or so until the early 2000s in which a lot of pivotal pieces of literature were published. Since then, it seems like the field has largely been exploring the implications of those studies (as well as quantitative and statistical methods, which may very well be undergoing a renaissance of their own, though I don't feel confident speaking to that). I had to reach a bit (*sorry...*) to find a more current paper that could reasonably be considered ground-breaking or disruptive and landed on "Species detection using environmental DNA from water samples" published in Biology Letters by Ficetola et al. (2008). The study was conducted on American bullfrogs, but has had extraordinary implications for fisheries and aquatic ecology more generally. It demonstrated an efficient, non-invasive, and highly sensitive method of detecting the presence of specific aquatic organisms, which facilitated later applications to monitoring invasive and cryptic species. It's tipped the scales for critically endangered species, seemingly preventing some Romeo and Juliet-esque scenarios. eDNA monitoring techniques are still in development, but show substantial promise with regard to what they can offer scientists.

I'm really hesitant to admit that disruptive science is declining in fisheries ecology, in part because I think that's a rather pessimistic view of the field. But it seems like the difficulty that I had finding a current, paradigm-shifting paper would support that trend. For better or worse, I think what I'm going to choose to believe is that there's some sort of periodicity to science - that there are probably prolonged seasons of consolidating science punctuated by shorter bouts of disruptive science. I think that perspective reconciles declines in disruptive science with a more optimistic point of view.

**Writing Prompt - Week 3**

*Reflect on the role of scientific computing in your discipline, particularly the use of programs, apps, and web-based tools for data analysis, management, data visualization, and communicating complex information to a broader audience. What challenges do you encounter when using these tools? Are there specific computing tools or techniques you currently use or plan to incorporate into your research?*

Frankly, I kind of resent the role that scientific computing has assumed in fisheries. I can obviously see the value of the analyses that it allows, but I personally identify as a boots-on-the-ground type of biologist and I really struggle with the learning curve associated with these tools and techniques.

I actually took an R-based ecological analysis course in my final semester of undergrad and it was awful. I failed the class, largely because it felt like something that I just couldn't understand. I realize now that teaching style had a lot to do with that, but I don't think I'm alone in that feeling. Some of these learning curves are really steep and feel impossible at times. While I'm relatively comfortable with R now, I think we should normalize being really bad at coding! And also remember that making observations of natural phenomena is the first step of the scientific method. Being an inquisitive and observant field biologist is no less important or valuable than being good at analysis and computing.

That being said, there's one really great new program that I'm excited about using in my research. Really all it does is streamline the sonar image processing that I have to do, but it's open source and represents an important step towards democratizing sonar surveys. Besides that, I'm trying to keep the computing in my research as simple as possible.

**Writing Prompt - Week 4**

*We left a couple of questions open-ended in our class discussion today. Please write 2-3 paragraphs addressing how you would handle reviewers of your own manuscript that provide feedback that you simply disagree with and/or contradicts feedback from another reviewer.*

I don't think that disagreement between reviewers or between authors and reviewers is inherently a bad thing. In fact, I think it can serve as an effective system of checks and balances when the peer review process is functioning the way it should. More eyes on a manuscript should mean that flaws which might go unnoticed by one reviewer would get caught by another. And reviews and recommendations should conflict sometimes because they're composed by humans who draw from different knowledge bases and experiences when formulating them. I think disagreements that arise in good faith are an important safeguard against scientific echo chambers.

And I think this is a fairly healthy framework for thinking about criticism, though its probably much more difficult to consider the bigger picture when faced with this scenario in "real life." I've not yet submitted a manuscript of my own, so I really don't have any first hand experience with this process from the author's perspective. But, I like to think I could accept disagreement between reviewers as an expression of checks and balances. And I'd like to think that I could consider my material in light of their perspectives and make a decision on what to keep, edit, or delete. I'd also like to think that if there was feedback that I had a good reason for disagreeing with, I'd stand by my work. I'm sure that's too idealistic and maybe a little reductive, but academia hasn't quite turned me into a cynic yet.
